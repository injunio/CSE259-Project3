Test Cases:

1.)
Rule 3- p,q => (p -> q)
Expected: p,p,q => q 
"We can derive the conclusion from the premises."
Command: 'run([p,q], [p -> q]).'

2.)
Rule 5- r,(p -> q) => p,q
Expected: (q,r => p,q) and (r=> p,p,q)
"We cannot derive the conclusion from the premises."
Command: 'run([r, (p -> q)], [p, q]).'

3.)
Rule 2 and 3- r,s => (p -> q) v r
Expected: r,s => (p -> q), r (rule 2)
p,r,s => q,r (rule 3)
"We can derive the conclusion from the premises."
Command: 'run([r, s], [(p -> q) v r]).'

4.)
Rule 1 and 3- ~s => (p -> q)
Expected: p, ~s => q (rule 3)
p => s, q
"We cannot derive the conclusion from the premises."
Command: 'run([~s], [p -> q]).'

5.)
Rule 1 and 4- p => ~(r), (p ^ q)
Expected: r, p => (p ^ q) (rule 1)
r, p => p (Rule 4)
r, p => q (Rule 4)
(gets to the the two conclusions in two ways: rule 1 done first and rule 4 done first)
"We cannot derive the conclusion from the premises."
Command: 'run([p], [~(r), (p ^ q)]).'
